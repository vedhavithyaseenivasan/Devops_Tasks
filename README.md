# 🚀 DevOps Learning Journey – Practical Tasks & Final Project

Welcome to my DevOps repository! This repository showcases my hands-on journey through core DevOps tools and practices. It includes five foundational tasks and one capstone project, covering automation, containerization, orchestration, monitoring, and alerting.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository is a collection of practical exercises completed during my DevOps training. Each task is designed to reinforce key concepts in continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD), container management, orchestration with Kubernetes, and real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

---

## ✅ Tasks Summary

### 🔧 Task 1: Jenkins Installation & Nginx Deployment
- Installed Jenkins and Java 17 on an Ubuntu system.
- Set up a **Freestyle Jenkins project** to deploy Nginx via a shell script.
- Demonstrated automation of web server setup through Jenkins UI.

---

### 🐳 Task 2: Docker Setup & Jenkins Pipeline Integration
- Installed Docker and linked it with Jenkins.
- Configured Docker credentials securely in Jenkins.
- Created a **Jenkins Pipeline** that:
  - Clones a GitHub repository.
  - Builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub.
  - Deploys containers using custom shell scripts.

---

### ☸️ Task 3: Kubernetes with Minikube
- Installed and configured **kubectl**, **Docker**, and **Minikube**.
- Created Kubernetes **Deployment** and **Service** YAML files.
- Deployed a Dockerized app to Kubernetes cluster.
- Exposed the application using `minikube service`.

---

### 📦 Task 4: Jenkins + Kubernetes – Node.js Pod Deployment
- Configured Jenkins to deploy a **Node.js application** in a Kubernetes pod.
- Created and applied a `node-deployment.yaml` file.
- Verified pod creation and status using `kubectl get pods`.

---

### ☕ Task 5: Maven Build Automation with Jenkins
- Installed **Maven** and configured **Java 17** in Jenkins.
- Forked a Java project and integrated it into Jenkins using pipeline scripts.
- Automated build and deployment using `build.sh` and `deploy.sh`.

---

## 📊 Final DevOps Project: Grafana Reporting & Alerting

A complete real-time system monitoring and alerting setup built using:
- **Prometheus** – for time-series metric collection.
- **Node Exporter** – for exposing system metrics.
- **Grafana** – for dashboard visualization.
- **Alertmanager + Email** – for alert notifications on resource thresholds.

### Key Features:
- Real-time CPU, memory, disk monitoring.
- Custom dashboards created in Grafana.
- Alert rules configured to trigger email notifications.
- Lightweight, terminal-based setup with YAML configuration files.
